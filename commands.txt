First create an empty folder with the package name.
Type-->  npm init
Leave the package name and version as it is shown. (You can later change the package name in package.json file if package name already taken)
Give a description of your own.
Leave the entry point as index.js
test command, git repository and keywords are optional.
Type the author name.
Type the license name.
Finally type yes if its all okay.
(A package.json file will be created inside the package folder)


(Now install some required dependencies)
1. npm install --save-dev react react-dom
2. List react and react-dom inside "peerdependencies" as well as "devdependencies"
3. Install storybook by typing --> npx sb init
   3.1 Installing storybook will also install babel-core and babel loader along with all library of storybook.
   3.2 It will also add an empty list of dependencies.
   3.3 Two new command script will be added.(storybook, build-storybook)

Now create the list of components inside src/components and export all the components in index.tsx file inside src folder.

Now to create a dist folder so as to publish in npm we will use rollup.js module bundler and some plugins--
1. npm install rollup rollup-plugin-babel @rollup/plugin-node-resolve rollup-plugin-peer-deps-external --save-dev
2. rollup-plugin-babel allows us to integrate with babel config(install using @babel/preset-react)
3. 

Now to use rollup create a file at root level and named it as rollup.config.js-->

import babel from 'rollup-plugin-babel';
import resolve from '@rollup/plugin-node-resolve';
import external from 'rollup-plugin-peer-deps-external';

export default [
    {
        input: "./src/index.tsx",
        output: [
            {
                file: "dist/index.tsx",
                format: "cjs"
            },
            {
                file: "dist/index.es.tsx",
                format: "es",
                export: "named",
            }
        ],
        plugins: [
            babel({
                exclude: "node_modules/**",
                presets: ["@babel/preset-react"],
            }),
            external(),
            resolve(),
        ]
    }
]

Now enter a command in the script in package.json --> "build-lib": "rollup -c"
